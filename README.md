### Hi 👋, I'm Pradeep

I'm working as a Tech & Software Craftsman to help scale business using technology. Currently as Head Of Engineering at [Kenko Health](http://kenkohealth.in/) Bangalore, India 🇮🇳, i'm leading a team of developers, qa and devops working out of India 🇮🇳. 

In my spare time I like to code 👨‍💻 in various languages including Java, Clojure/ClojureScript ❤️, Python, Javascript, Bash and a few other. 
I love open source projects and advocate of functional programming paradigm (& clean code).

Beside coding 👨‍💻, I love reading books 📚, traveling 🌄, football ⚽ and listening to music 🎶.
